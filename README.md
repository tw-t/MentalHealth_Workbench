## Mental Health Prediction Using Machine Learning
The 2024 Kaggle Playground Series aims to provide engaging and practical datasets for machine learning enthusiasts to enhance their skills. This project focuses on Mental Health Prediction, using data from a mental health survey to analyze the factors that contribute to depression. The goal is to build a predictive model that determines whether an individual is experiencing depression based on various factors present in the dataset.

The dataset contains missing values, requiring preprocessing techniques such as data imputation and visualization for better insights. Various data analysis techniques, including count plots, pie charts, and correlation maps, will be used to understand the key contributing factors to depression.
